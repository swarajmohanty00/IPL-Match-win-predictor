# 🏏 IPL Win Predictor

A Machine Learning project to predict the outcome of IPL matches based on historical match and ball-by-ball data.
This project preprocesses raw IPL datasets, trains a model, and provides predictions through an interactive app.

## 📊 Dataset

The project uses the following datasets:

- **matches.csv** → Match-level info (teams, venue, winner, toss, etc.)
- **deliveries.csv** → Ball-by-ball deliveries data

---

## 🧠 Model

- Trained using scikit-learn
- Encoded features: teams, venue, toss decision, etc.
- Saved as `model.joblib` for reusability

---

## 📌 Future Improvements

- Add more features (player stats, weather, toss impact, etc.)
- Use advanced models (XGBoost, Random Forest, Deep Learning)
- Deploy the app on **Streamlit Cloud / Heroku / AWS**
